		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> Auston Matthews is an American professional ice hockey player for the 
		Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League. Previously, Matthews 
		played for the U.S. National U18 Team in the USHL. Widely considered 
		the top prospect of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, Matthews was drafted 
		first overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs.  </p>
		
		<h2> The Rising Phenom </h2>
		<p> In his NHL debut Matthews became the first player in modern NHL history
		to score four goals in his NHL debut. He scored 40 goals in his first 
		season, the second rookie since the 2004&minus;05 lockout to reach the 
		milestone and the fourth teenager in league history to do so. In the 
		midst of his rookie season, Matthews was ranked the second best active 
		American player in the NHL. He was awarded the 2017 Calder Memorial 
		Trophy as the top NHL rookie. </p>
	
		<h2> Early Life </h2>
		<p> Born in San Ramon, California, Matthews and his family moved to 
		Scottsdale, Arizona when Matthews was an infant. He learned to play 
		hockey in Arizona, developing an interest after watching the local 
		Phoenix Coyotes, another NHL team play.</p>
		
		<h2> Playing Career </h2>
		<h3> Junior </h3>
		<p> Matthews was drafted 57th overall by the Everett Silvertips in 
		the 2012 WHL Bantam Draft but opted to play for the United States 
		National Team Development Program, who play in the junior United 
		States Hockey League. That season he played for the U.S. 
		National U17 Team  where he gained national attention from 
		NHL scouts. In his second season with the U.S. National U18 Team, 
		Matthews finished first in league scoring with 116 points breaking the 
		National Team Development Program record of 102. On May 21, 2015, 
		Matthews won the USA Hockey Bob Johnson Award for excellence in 
		international competition.
		<h3> Toronto Maple Leafs </p>
		<p> In late June, Matthews was selected first overall in the 2016 draft 
		by the Toronto Maple Leafs. He had been widely expected to go 
		first overall for over a year leading up to the event, consistently 
		topping prospect charts and major scouting reporters. On July 21, the 
		two parties finalized a deal, with Matthews inking a three-year entry-level 
		contract, which included the maximum allocation of performance bonuses. 

		<p>Matthews made his NHL debut in the Maple Leafs' first game of the 
			season on October 12, 2016, against the Ottawa Senators. He scored 
			four goals in the game, all against Craig Anderson. This was the first 
			time in modern NHL history a player scored four goals in his debut. 
			On January 10, 2017, Mathews was the only Leafs player 
			selected to participate in the 2017 NHL All-Star Game. On March 28, 2017, 
			Matthews scored his 35th goal of the season, beating Wendel Clark's previous 
			record for most goals in a season (34) by a Leafs' rookie. On April 3rd,
			Matthews score his 39th goal and 67th point, breaking the franchise record 
			for most points in a season as well as the record for most goals by an American 
			born rookie. A few days later he notched his 40th goal of the season, becoming 
			the second rookie since the 2004â€“05 lockout to reach the milestone and only 
			the fourth teenager in league history to do so. He would finish the year 
			with 40 goals, good enough for second most in the league. Matthews' play 
			assisted the Maple Leafs in making the playoffs for the first time in a 
			full season since 2004, where the team took on the top seeded Washington 
			Capitals in the first round. After going pointless in the first two games 
			of the series, Matthews scored in each of the last four games as the team 
			was eliminated in six contests by the Capitals. His four consecutive games 
			with a goal marked the first time since 1986 where a teenager scored in four 
			straight playoff games, with Maple Leafs alumnus Wendel Clark being the only 
			other player in league history to accomplish the feat. In recognition for 
			his historic accomplishments throughout the year, Matthews was awarded the 
			Calder Memorial Trophy, as the league's top rookie, with 164 of 167 first-place votes.
